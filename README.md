# Wordpress Theme for Beauty salon

## :dart: About The Project ##
In this project you can find a simple wordpress theme that was developed for a beauty salon.
I used 2 plugins, Contact Form 7 for the contact form and Elementor to insert the map.
This was made to complete the Start2impact "Wordpress" Superguide.

## :dart: How can I improve? ##
Because I was not familiar with PHP I struggled a lot in the beginning so I will definitely need to focus on learning PHP language in the future. I'm proud of what I managed to create anyway but I know that It could have some improvements on some parts. 
In my next Wordpress projects I would like to try all the Elementor functionalities for full development of websites.
